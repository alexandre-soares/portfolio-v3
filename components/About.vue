    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Hello (again), I’m Romain Paget, I never knew why but the real John
      Sculley is one of my Facebook and LinkedIn friends, I live in Paris,
      France since 5 years, I grew up in Normandy but was born in Jura: my heart
      is a Neufchâtel that makes yellow wine flow in my veins!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a designer, with nearly a decade of experience, graduated from
      Gobelins, Image School, who specialized in digital product design, but
      curious about a lot of stuff!
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve worked on a wide range of digital products, for luxury, news,
      ecommerce, culture and more!
